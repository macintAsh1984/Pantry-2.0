		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>At the Pantry we work to destigmatize and fight against food insecurity, so that no student will have to miss a meal. We seek to promote student health by providing free access to nutrition and other basic necessities.</p>

		<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
		<p><b style="font-family: RubikBold; font: size 16px;">Mobile Pantry:</b> We now periodically offer Pantry services elsewhere across the UC Davis campus, to increase accessibility of food and basic needs items at various sites other than the MU. We did our first run of the Mobile Pantry on March 7, 2023 in front of the SCC!
		<br>
		<br><b style="font-family: RubikBold; font: size 16px;">Menstrual Bill:</b> Recently, we advocated for a Bill to allocate a budget to purchase menstrual products with the purpose of providing basic essential items to our students. It was successfully passed on February 9, 2023.
		<br>
		<br><b style="font-family: RubikBold; font: size 16px;">Spice Jar Program:</b> Our revamped Spice Jar Program launched in January, allowing patrons to bring their own containers to get up to 2 spices -- no need to order in advance!
		<br>
		<br><b style="font-family: RubikBold; font: size 16px;">A Bag For A Bag:</b> This is a new program that we started in Winter 2023 to promote sustainability while reducing the use of single-use grocery bags. Patrons bring in grocery/paper/plastic bags to receive a reusable Pantry tote bag.</p>
